//Switch Statement
/*
Another way to check the matc betwen two or more expressions is using the switch statement, it's exactly like the if but with little differences

here's an example:
*/

let gender = "M"

switch (gender) {
    case "F":
        console.log("F");
        break;
    case "M":
        console.log("M");

    default:
        break;
}
