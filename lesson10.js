//Lets talk about some concept on javascript language

//in javascript you cant use double quotes on your codes
console.log("Double")

//but you can use single quotes
console.log('Single')

//Difrent by other program languages, in JS u don't need
//to use semicolon on your codes
//it's optional
console.log('wiht - semicolon')
console.log('wihtout - semicolon');
//the code will run normally
